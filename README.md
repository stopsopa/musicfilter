# Music Filter

Music Filter is a lightweight desktop utility designed for efficient music library curation. It allows users to quickly preview, organize, and filter large collections of MP3 files through a streamlined, keyboard-driven interface.

## Key Features

- **Drag & Drop**: Effortlessly load individual MP3 files or entire folders.
- **Instant Preview**: Navigate through your song list and hear previews immediately with `UP`/`DOWN` arrows.
- **Fast Navigation**: Seek through tracks using `LEFT`/`RIGHT` arrows.
- **Safe Filtering**: Pressing `BACKSPACE` moves files to a local `_deleted` folder, allowing for quick curation without immediate permanent deletion.
- **Metadata Visibility**: View track information (Title, Artist, Album) at a glance.

Most usable version of this app seems to be the one Electron based using ffmpeg internally: [electron](electron/README.md)
