          # 1.1 Detection Strategy:
          # semantic-release doesn't easily output "I just created v1.0.1". 
          # So we detect it by checking the latest git tag BEFORE and AFTER running it.

          # Step A: Get the latest tag present currently
          git fetch --tags
          OLD_TAG=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "")

          # Step B: Run semantic-release (creates new tag if changes exist)

          # Step C: Get the latest tag again
          git fetch --tags
